# resize

# step1: make a new bigger table/array
# stpe2: go through all the old elements, and hash into the new list
    # :going through all the elements is O(n)
    # :Double the size of the table every resize


# When you put()
#     if load > 0.7:
#         double capacioty

# when you del()
#     if load < .2:
#         havle the capacioty/down to some minimum
